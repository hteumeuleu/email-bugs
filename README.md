# Email Bugs
**A repository for documenting bugs in webmails and email applications**, inspired by [Device Bugs](https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs) and [SVG Weirdness](https://github.com/emilbjorklund/svg-weirdness).

The goal is to make email designers life easier in order to find and understand weird email clients behaviors. 
But it's also to try to improve the situation by reporting each bug to the concerned company.
